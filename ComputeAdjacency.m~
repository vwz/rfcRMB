function [batchtau] = ComputeAdjacency(batchdata, params) 

% This program computes the adjacency matrix for each batch of batchdata.
% The program assumes that the following variables are set externally:% batchdata  -- the labeled data that is divided into batches (numcases numdims numbatches)
%
% The program outputs the following variables:
% batchtau   -- the adjacency matrix based on batchdata, it is a sparse matrix on numcases*numcases*numbatches

options = make_options('NN', params.NN);

[numcases, numhid, numbatches] = size(batchdata);
batchtau = [];
for batch=1:numbatches
    X = batchdata(:,:,batch);
    W = adjacency(options, X);
    batchtau{batch} = W;
