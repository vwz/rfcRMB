function [m] = Tensor2Matrix(t)

%% This program converts a tensor (ndim1, ndim2, ndim3) into a matrix (ndim1*ndim3, ndim2)
%
% The program assumes that the following variables are set externally:
% t  -- the tensor, whose dimensions are (ndim1, ndim2, ndim3)
%
% The program outputs the following variables:
% m  -- the matrix, whose dimensions are (ndim1*ndim3, ndim2)

[ndim1, ndim2, ndim3] = size(t);
m = [];
for i = 1:ndim3
    m = [m; t(:,:,i)];
end
